_Nothing yet._

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-22

Initial public-on-GitHub release. Snapshot of TeXLib after the documentation pass and CI wiring.

### Added

- **Core packages.** `basic-utilities.sty`, `course-metadata.sty` (v8.1 layered metadata engine), `texlib-build.sty` (unified build flags), `texlib-footer.sty`, `texlib-mathutils.sty`, `texlib-theorems.sty`. `quiver.sty` vendored from https://q.uiver.app.
- **Document-class modules.** `bingo`, `autoexam` (with `autoexam_engine.lua` for randomized exams), `didactic` (lecture notes), `pset` (problem sets), `quiz`, `report-card`, `schedule` (with `date.lua` / `calendar.lua` / `schedule.lua`), `syllabus`. Each module ships with a `.cls`, a `template.tex`, and a `README.md`.
- **Smoke-test harness.** [`smoke_test.py`](smoke_test.py) builds every module's `template.tex` and reports pass/fail. Supports `--modes all` to also build with `\StudentMode`, `\ShowKey`, `\ShowSolutions`.
- **Sublime Text integration.** Custom builder `texlib_builder.py` plus build system, command-palette entries, and LaTeXTools settings. See [`Sublime/README.md`](Sublime/README.md).
- **GitHub Actions CI.** `.github/workflows/smoke.yml` runs `smoke_test.py` on every push and PR inside a TeX Live full container; uploads `.log` files as artifacts on failure.
- **Quickstart documentation.** New per-machine and per-course setup walkthroughs in the README, plus [`coursemeta.example.tex`](coursemeta.example.tex) as a copy-paste starting point.
- **MIT license** (with a carve-out noting `quiver.sty` is third-party).

### Notes

- `course-metadata_old.sty` (v7) was archived on the `archive/old-metadata` branch before deletion. Recoverable from there if ever needed.
- A handful of pre-class-consolidation prototypes (`Bingo/bingo.tex`, `Bingo/bingo_og.tex`, `Bingo/Math 181 Su25 *.tex`) and dev-test files (`Notes/test_aliases.*`, `Notes/test_conv_fix.*`, `Notes/test_labeledsection.*`) were deleted from disk before the first commit, so they have no history in this repo.
